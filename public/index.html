            <h2>How To Play Fantasy Valorant</h2>
            <p>Fantasy Valorant is an engaging way for fans to immerse themselves deeper into the world of Valorant esports by creating their own virtual teams of professional players and competing based on their performance in real tournaments. Here’s a detailed guide on how to play Fantasy Valorant:</p>
            
            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Choose a Platform:</strong> Start by selecting a fantasy sports platform that offers Fantasy Valorant. These platforms provide the infrastructure to create leagues, draft players, and track scores.</li>
                <li><strong>Create or Join a League:</strong> Leagues are where the action happens. You can join public leagues or create private leagues with friends. Each league has its own set of rules and scoring system.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Drafting Players</h3>
            <ol start="3">
                <li><strong>Drafting Players:</strong> Before the tournament begins, participate in a draft where you and other managers select players to form your team.</li>
                <li><strong>Player Salaries and Budgets:</strong> Each player has a salary cap value. Managers must stay within a budget while drafting their team. Balancing star players with emerging talents is key to maximizing your team’s potential.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Managing Your Team</h3>
            <ol start="5">
                <li><strong>Setting Lineups:</strong> Once drafted, you’ll need to set your lineup for each game week or tournament phase.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategizing:</strong> Consider factors like player form, team matchups, and map preferences when setting your lineup. Some platforms allow you to make substitutions between game days to optimize your team's performance.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Scoring Points</h3>
            <ol start="7">
                <li><strong>Scoring System:</strong> Points are awarded based on players' in-game performance. Common scoring categories include kills, deaths, assists, headshots, multi-kills, and round wins. The specific scoring rules vary by platform and league settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Following Matches:</strong> Keep track of how your players are performing in real-time during matches. Fantasy platforms update scores live, allowing you to see how each player contributes to your team’s total points.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Competing and Winning</h3>
            <ol start="9">
                <li><strong>League Rankings:</strong> Throughout the tournament, your team competes against others in your league. Standings are based on cumulative points earned by your players. Compete for weekly prizes or aim for the season-long championship.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic Moves:</strong> As the tournament progresses, consider trading players or adjusting your lineup based on player form and upcoming matchups. Strategic moves can give you an edge over your competitors.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Enjoying the Experience</h3>
            <ol start="11">
                <li><strong>Community and Engagement:</strong> Fantasy Valorant isn’t just about the competition; it’s also about engaging with the community. Discuss strategies, player performances, and game insights with other managers in your league.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning and Improvement:</strong> Each tournament provides insights into player strengths and team dynamics. Use this knowledge to refine your drafting and management strategies for future tournaments.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
